Basic I/O
=========

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


Every PDB image interaction is done through classes defined by the ``AsmResolver.Symbols.Pdb`` namespace:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using AsmResolver.Symbols.Pdb;


Creating a new PDB Image
------------------------

Creating a new image can be done by instantiating a ``PdbImage`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var image = new PdbImage();


Opening a PDB Image
-------------------

Opening a PDB Image can be done through one of the ``FromXXX`` methods from the ``PdbImage`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

    byte[] raw = ...
    var image = PdbImage.FromBytes(raw);
    
.. code-block:: csharp

    var image = PdbImage.FromFile(@"C:\myfile.pdb");

.. code-block:: csharp

    MsfFile msfFile = ...
    var image = PdbImage.FromFile(msfFile);

.. code-block:: csharp

    BinaryStreamReader reader = ...
    var image = PdbImage.FromReader(reader);


If you want to read large files (+100MB), consider using memory mapped I/O instead:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using var service = new MemoryMappedFileService();
    var image = PdbImage.FromFile(service.OpenFile(@"C:\myfile.pdb"));


Writing a PDB Image
-------------------

Writing PDB images directly is currently not supported yet, however there are plans to making this format fully serializable.


Creating a new MSF File
-----------------------

Multi-Stream Format (MSF) files are files that form the backbone structure of all PDB images. 
AsmResolver fully supports this lower level type of access to MSF files using the ``MsfFile`` class.

To create a new MSF file, use one of its constructors:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var msfFile = new MsfFile();


.. code-block:: csharp

    var msfFile = new MsfFile(blockSize: 4096);


Opening an MSF File
-------------------

Opening existing MSF files can be done in a very similar fashion as reading a PDB Image:

.. code-block:: csharp

    byte[] raw = ...
    var msfFile = MsfFile.FromBytes(raw);

.. code-block:: csharp

    var msfFile = MsfFile.FromFile(@"C:\myfile.pdb");

.. code-block:: csharp

    BinaryStreamReader reader = ...
    var msfFile = MsfFile.FromReader(reader);

    
Similar to reading PDB images, if you want to read large files (+100MB), consider using memory mapped I/O instead:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using var service = new MemoryMappedFileService();
    var msfFile = MsfFile.FromFile(service.OpenFile(@"C:\myfile.pdb"));


Writing an MSF File
-------------------

Writing an MSF file can be done through one of the ``Write`` method overloads.

.. code-block:: csharp

    msfFile.Write(@"C:\myfile.patched.pdb");
