Symbols
=======

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


Symbol records define the top-level metadata of a binary, such as public functions, global fields, compiler information, and user-defined type definitions.
They are stored in either the global symbols stream, or in individual module streams.

In the following, we will discuss various methods for accessing symbols defined in a PDB file.


Global Symbols
--------------

The ``PdbImage`` class defines a ``Symbols`` property, exposing all globally defined symbols in the PDB:

.. code-block:: csharp 

    PdbImage image = ...;

    foreach (var symbol in image.Symbols)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(symbol);
    }


You can use LINQ's collection extensions to obtain symbols of a specific type.
For example, the following iterates over all global public symbols:

.. code-block:: csharp 

    PdbImage image = ...;

    foreach (var symbol in image.Symbols.Where(s => s.CodeViewSymbolType == CodeViewSymbolType.Pub32))
    {
        Console.WriteLine(symbol);
    }


Most types of symbol are represented by their own dedicated subclass of ``CodeViewSymbol`` in AsmResolver.
To get a more strongly typed filtering, use the ``OfType<T>()`` extension to also automatically cast to the specific symbol type.
The following iterates over all global public symbols, and automatically casts them to the appropriate ``PublicSymbol`` type:

.. code-block:: csharp 

    PdbImage image = ...;

    foreach (var symbol in image.Symbols.OfType<PublicSymbol>())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}, Section: {1}, Offset: {2:X8}.",
            symbol.Name,
            symbol.SegmentIndex,
            symbol.Offset);
    }


.. note:: 

    Since this part of the API is a work-in-process, any symbol that is currently not supported or recognized by AsmResolver's parser will be represented by an instance of the ``UnknownSymbol`` class, exposing the raw data of the symbol.


Module Symbols
--------------

PDB images may define symbols that are only valid within the scope of a single module (typically single compilands and object files).
These can be accessed via the ``PdbImage::Modules`` property, and each module defines its own ``Symbols`` property:


.. code-block:: csharp 

    PdbImage image = ...;

    foreach (var module in image.Modules)
    {
        Console.WriteLine(module.Name);
        foreach (var symbol in image.Symbols)
            Console.WriteLine("\t- {0}", symbol);
        Console.WriteLine();
    }


Local Symbols
-------------

Records such as the ``ProcedureSymbol`` class may contain multiple sub-symbols.
These type of symbols all implement ``ICodeViewScopeSymbol``, and define their own set of ``Symbols``. 
This way, the symbol tree can be traversed recursively.

Below is an example snippet of obtaining all local variable symbols defined within the ``DllMain`` function of a library:

.. code-block:: csharp 

    PdbImage image = ...;

    var module = image.Modules.First(m => m.Name == @"c:\simpledll\release\dllmain.obj");
    var procedure = module.Symbols.OfType<ProcedureSymbol>().First(p => p.Name == "DllMain");

    foreach (var local in image.Symbols.OfType<LocalSymbol>())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Name: {0}, Type: {1}", 
            local.Name,
            local.VariableType);
    }


.. note:: 

    In the PDB file format, symbols that define a scope (such as ``S_LPROC32`` records) end their scope with a special ``S_END`` symbol record in the file.
    However, AsmResolver does **not** include these ending records in the list of symbols. 
    Ending records are automatically interpreted and inserted when appropriate during the writing process by AsmResolver, and should thus not be expected in the list, nor added to the list manually.
