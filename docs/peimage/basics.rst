Basic I/O
=========

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


Every PE image interaction is done through classes defined by the ``AsmResolver.PE`` namespace:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using AsmResolver.PE;

Creating a new PE image
-----------------------

Creating a new image can be done by instantiating a ``PEImage`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var peImage = new PEImage();


Opening a PE image
------------------

Opening an image can be done through one of the `FromXXX` methods from the ``PEImage`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

    byte[] raw = ...
    var peImage = PEImage.FromBytes(raw);

.. code-block:: csharp

    var peImage = PEImage.FromFile(@"C:\myfile.exe");

.. code-block:: csharp

    IPEFile peFile = ...
    var peImage = PEImage.FromFile(peFile);

.. code-block:: csharp

    BinaryStreamReader reader = ...
    var peImage = PEImage.FromReader(reader);


If you want to read large files (+100MB), consider using memory mapped I/O instead:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using var service = new MemoryMappedFileService();
    var peImage = PEImage.FromFile(service.OpenFile(@"C:\myfile.exe"));


On Windows, if a module is loaded and mapped in memory (e.g. as a native dependency or by the means of ``LoadLibrary``), it is possible to load the PE image from memory by providing the ``HINSTANCE`` (a.k.a. module base address):

.. code-block:: csharp

    IntPtr hInstance = ...
    var peImage = PEImage.FromModuleBaseAddress(hInstance);


Writing a PE image
-------------------

Building an image back to a PE file can be done manually by constructing a ``PEFile``, or by using one of the classes that implement the ``IPEFileBuilder`` interface. 

.. note::
    
    Currently AsmResolver only provides a full fletched builder for .NET images.


Building a .NET image can be done through the ``AsmResolver.PE.DotNet.Builder.ManagedPEFileBuilder`` class:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var builder = new ManagedPEFileBuilder();
    var newPEFile = builder.CreateFile(image);

Once a ``PEFile`` instance has been generated from the image, you can use it to write the executable to an output stream (such as a file on the disk or a memory stream).

.. code-block:: csharp

    using (var stream = File.Create(@"C:\mynewfile.exe"))
    {
        var writer = new BinaryStreamWriter(stream);
        newPEFile.Write(writer);
    }


For more information on how to construct arbitrary ``PEFile`` instances for native images, look at :ref:`pe-building`.


Strong name signing
-------------------

If the PE image is a .NET image, it can be signed with a strong-name. Open a strong name private key from a file:
                                                                     
.. code-block:: csharp
 
    var snk = StrongNamePrivateKey.FromFile(@"C:\Path\To\keyfile.snk");

Make sure that the strong name directory is present and has the correct size. 

.. code-block:: csharp

    image.DotNetDirectory.StrongName = new DataSegment(new byte[snk.Modulus.Length]);
    
After writing the PE image to an output stream, use the ``StrongNameSigner`` class to sign the image.

.. code-block:: csharp

    using Stream outputStream = ...
    
    var signer = new StrongNameSigner(snk);
    signer.SignImage(outputStream, module.Assembly.HashAlgorithm);
