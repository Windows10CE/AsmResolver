Exceptions Directory
====================

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


Structured Exception Handling (SEH) in native programming languages such as C++ are for some platforms implemented using exception handler tables. These are tables that store ranges of addresses that are protected by an exception handler. In the PE file format, these tables are stored in the Exceptions Data Directory. 

The relevant classes for this article are stored in the following namespace:

.. code-block:: csharp

    using AsmResolver.PE.Exceptions;


Runtime Functions
-----------------

The ``IPEImage`` interface exposes these tables through the ``Exceptions`` property. This is of type ``IExceptionsDirectory``, which allows for read access to instances of ``IRuntimeFunction`` through the ``GetEntries`` method.  This interface models all the runtime functions through the method, in a platform agnostic manner.

.. code-block:: csharp

    foreach (var function in peImage.Exceptions.GetEntries())
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Begin: {0:X8}.", function.Begin.Rva);
        Console.WriteLine("End: {0:X8}.", function.End.Rva);
    }


Different platforms use different physical formats for their runtime functions. To figure out what kind of format an image is using, check the ``Machine`` field in the file header of the PE file.

.. note::
    
    Currently AsmResolver only supports reading exception tables of PE files targeting the AMD64 (x86 64-bit) architecture.


AMD64 / x64 
-----------

AsmResolver provides the ``X64ExceptionsDirectory`` and ``X64RuntimeFunction`` classes that implement the exceptions directory for the AMD64 (x86 64-bit) architecture. Next to just the start and end address, this implementation also provides access to the unwind info. 

.. code-block:: csharp

    var directory = (X64ExceptionsDirectory) peImage.Exceptions;

    foreach (var function in directory.Entries)
    {
        Console.WriteLine("Begin: {0:X8}.", function.Begin.Rva);
        Console.WriteLine("End: {0:X8}.", function.End.Rva);

        var unwindInfo = function.UnwindInfo;

        // Get handler start.
        Console.WriteLine("Handler Start: {0:X8}.", unwindInfo.ExceptionHandler.Rva);

        // Read custom SEH data associated to this unwind information.
        var dataReader = function.ExceptionHandlerData.CreateReader();
        // ...
    }
