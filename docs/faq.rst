Frequently Asked Questions
==========================

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!



Why are there so many libraries / packages instead of just one?
---------------------------------------------------------------

Not everyone will need everything from the code base of AsmResolver. For example, someone that is only interested in reading the PE headers of an input file does not require any of the functionality of the ``AsmResolver.DotNet`` package.

This is why AsmResolver's design philosophy is not to be one monolithic library, but rather be a toolsuite of libraries. By splitting up in multiple smaller libraries, the user can carefully select the packages that they need and leave out what they do not need. This can easily shave off 100s of kilobytes from the total size of code that is shipped.


Why does AsmResolver throw so many errors on reading/writing?
-------------------------------------------------------------

AsmResolver does verification of the input file, and if it finds anything that is out of place or not according to specification, it will report this to the ``IErrorListener`` passed onto the reader parameters. A similar thing happens when serializing the input application back to the disk. By default, this translates to an exception being thrown (e.g. you might have seen a ``System.AggregateException`` being thrown upon writing). 

AsmResolver often can ignore and recover from kinds of errors, but this is not enabled by default. To enable these, please refer to :ref:`pe-custom-error-handling` (for .NET images: :ref:`dotnet-advanced-module-reading` and :ref:`dotnet-image-builder-diagnostics`). Be careful with ignoring errors though. Especially for disabling writer verification can cause the output to not work anymore unless you know what you are doing.

If it still breaks and you believe it is a bug, please report it on the `issues board <https://github.com/Washi1337/AsmResolver/issues>`_.


Why does the executable not work anymore after modifying it with AsmResolver?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------

A couple of things can be happening here: 

- AsmResolver´s PE builder has a bug.
- You are changing something in the executable you are not supposed to change.
- You are changing something that results in the executable not function anymore.
- The target binary is actively trying to prevent you from applying any modifications (this happens a lot with obfuscated binaries).

With great power comes great responsibility. Changing the wrong things in the input executable file can result in the output stop working.

For .NET applications, make sure your application conforms with specification (`ECMA-335 <https://www.ecma-international.org/publications/files/ECMA-ST/ECMA-335.pdf>`_). To help you with finding problems in your final output, try reopening the executable in AsmResolver and look for errors reported by the reader. Alternatively, using tools such as ``peverify`` for .NET Framework applications (usually located in ``C:\Program Files (x86)\Microsoft SDKs\Windows\v10.0A\bin\NETFX X.X Tools.``) or ``dotnet ILVerify`` for .NET Core / .NET 5+ applications, can also help narrowing down what might have gone wrong.

If you believe it is a bug in AsmResolver, please report it on the `issues board <https://github.com/Washi1337/AsmResolver/issues>`_.


In Mono.Cecil / dnlib my code works, but it does not work in AsmResolver, why? 
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Essentially, two things can be happening here: 

- AsmResolver´s code could have a bug.
- You are misusing AsmResolver´s API.

It is important to remember that, while the public API of ``AsmResolver.DotNet`` looks similar on face value to other libraries (such as Mono.Cecil or dnlib), AsmResolver itself follows a very different design philosophy than these libraries. As such, a lot of classes in those libraries will not map one-to-one to AsmResolver classes directly. Check the documentation to make sure you are not misusing the API.

If you believe it is a bug, please report it on the `issues board <https://github.com/Washi1337/AsmResolver/issues>`_.


Does AsmResolver have a concept similar to writer events in dnlib? 
------------------------------------------------------------------

No. 

Instead, to have more control over how the final output executable file will look like, AsmResolver works in layers of abstraction. For example, you can manually serialize a ``ModuleDefinition`` to a ``PEImage`` first, before writing it to the disk. This class exposes more low level structures of the executable file, which can all be changed before writing to the disk.
