===========

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


This is the documentation of the AsmResolver project. AsmResolver is a set of libraries allowing .NET programmers to read, modify and write executable files. This includes .NET as well as native images. The library exposes high-level representations of the PE, while still allowing the user to access low-level structures.
