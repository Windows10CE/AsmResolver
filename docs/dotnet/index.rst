The .NET image layer is the third layer of abstraction of the portable executable (PE) file format. It provides a high-level abstraction of the .NET metadata stored in a PE image, that is similar to APIs like ``System.Reflection``. Its root objects are ``AssemblyDefinition`` and ``ModuleDefinition``, and from there it is possible to dissect the .NET assembly hierarchically.

In short, this means the following:

* Assemblies define modules,
* Modules define types, resources and external references,
* Types define members such as methods, fields, properties and events,
* Methods include method bodies,
* ... and so on.

The third layer of abstraction is the highest level of abstraction for a .NET assembly that AsmResolver provides. All objects exposed by this layer are completely mutable and can be serialized back to a ``IPEImage`` from the second layer, to a ``PEFile`` from the first layer, or to the disk.
