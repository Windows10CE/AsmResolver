Advanced PE Image Building
==========================

.. note:: 

    The documentation has a new home: `Check it out <https://docs.washi.dev/asmresolver>`_!


The easiest way to write a .NET module to the disk is by using the ``Write`` method:

.. code-block:: csharp

    module.Write(@"C:\Path\To\Output\Binary.exe");


This method is essentially a shortcut for invoking the ``ManagedPEImageBuilder`` and ``ManagedPEFileBuilder`` classes, and will completely reconstruct the PE image, serialize it into a PE file and write the PE file to the disk. 

While this is easy, and would probably work for most .NET module processing, it does not provide much flexibility. 
To get more control over the construction of the new PE image, it is therefore not recommended to use a different overload of the ``Write`` method that takes instances of ``IPEImageBuilder`` instead:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var imageBuilder = new ManagedPEImageBuilder();
    
    /* Configuration of imageBuilder here... */

    module.Write(@"C:\Path\To\Output\Binary.exe", imageBuilder);


Alternatively, it is possible to call ``ModuleDefinition::ToPEImage`` to turn the module into a ``PEImage`` first, that can then later be post-processed and transformed into a ``PEFile`` to write it to the disk:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var imageBuilder = new ManagedPEImageBuilder();
    
    /* Configuration of imageBuilder here... */

    // Construct image.
    var image = module.ToPEImage(imageBuilder);

    // Write image to the disk.
    var fileBuilder = new ManagedPEFileBuilder();
    var file = fileBuilder.CreateFile(image);
    file.Write(@"C:\Path\To\Output\Binary.exe");


To get even more control, it is possible to call the ``CreateImage`` method from the image builder directly. 
This allows for inspecting all build artifacts, as well as post-processing of the constructed PE image before it is written to the disk.

.. code-block:: csharp

    var imageBuilder = new ManagedPEImageBuilder();
    
    /* Configuration of imageBuilder here... */

    // Construct image.
    var result = imageBuilder.CreateImage(module);

    /* Inspect build result ... */

    // Obtain constructed PE image.
    var image = result.ConstructedImage;
    
    /* Post processing of image happens here... */

    // Write image to the disk.
    var fileBuilder = new ManagedPEFileBuilder();
    var file = fileBuilder.CreateFile(image);
    file.Write(@"C:\Path\To\Output\Binary.exe");


This article explores various features about the ``ManagedPEImageBuilder`` class.


Token mappings
--------------

Upon constructing a new PE image for a module, members defined in the module might be re-ordered. This can make post-processing of the PE image difficult, as metadata members cannot be looked up by their original metadata token anymore. The ``PEImageBuildResult`` object returned by ``CreateImage`` defines a property called ``TokenMapping``. This object maps all members that were included in the construction of the PE image to the newly assigned metadata tokens, allowing for new metadata rows to be looked up easily and efficiently.

.. code-block:: csharp

    var mainMethod = module.ManagedEntrypointMethod;

    // Build PE image.
    var result = imageBuilder.CreateImage(module);

    // Look up the new metadata row assigned to the main method.
    var newToken = result.TokenMapping[mainMethod];
    var mainMethodRow = result.ConstructedImage.DotNetDirectory.Metadata
        .GetStream<TablesStream>()
        .GetTable<MethodDefinitionRow>()
        .GetByRid(newToken.Rid);


Preserving raw metadata structure
---------------------------------

Some .NET modules are carefully crafted and rely on the raw structure of all metadata streams. These kinds of modules often rely on one of the following:

- RIDs of rows within a metadata table.
- Indices of blobs within the ``#Blob``, ``#Strings``, ``#US`` or ``#GUID`` heaps.
- Unknown or unconventional metadata streams and their order.

The default PE image builder for .NET modules (``ManagedPEImageBuilder``) defines a property called ``DotNetDirectoryFactory``, which contains the object responsible for constructing the .NET data directory, can be configured to preserve as much of this structure as possible. With the help of the ``MetadataBuilderFlags`` enum, it is possible to indicate which structures of the metadata directory need to preserved. The following table provides an overview of all preservation metadata builder flags that can be used and combined:

+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| flag                                   | Description                                                       |
+========================================+===================================================================+
| ``PreserveXXXIndices``                 | Preserves all row indices of the original ``XXX`` metadata table. |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveTableIndices``               | Preserves all row indices from all original metadata tables.      |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveBlobIndices``                | Preserves all blob indices in the ``#Blob`` stream.               |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveGuidIndices``                | Preserves all GUID indices in the ``#GUID`` stream.               |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveStringIndices``              | Preserves all string indices in the ``#Strings`` stream.          |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveUserStringIndices``          | Preserves all user-string indices in the ``#US`` stream.          |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveUnknownStreams``             | Preserves any of the unknown / unconventional metadata streams.   |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveStreamOrder``                | Preserves the original order of all metadata streams.             |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+
| ``PreserveAll``                        | Preserves as much of the original metadata as possible.           |
+----------------------------------------+-------------------------------------------------------------------+


Below is an example on how to configure the image builder to preserve blob data and all metadata tokens to type references:

.. code-block:: csharp

    var factory = new DotNetDirectoryFactory();
    factory.MetadataBuilderFlags = MetadataBuilderFlags.PreserveBlobIndices 
                                 | MetadataBuilderFlags.PreserveTypeReferenceIndices;
    imageBuilder.DotNetDirectoryFactory = factory;


.. warning::

    Preserving heap indices copies over the original contents of the heaps to the new PE image "as-is". While AsmResolver tries to reuse blobs defined in the original heaps as much as possible, this is often not possible without also preserving RIDs in the tables stream. This might result in a significant increase in file size.

.. note::

    Preserving RIDs within metadata tables might require AsmResolver to inject placeholder rows in existing metadata tables that are solely there to fill up space between existing rows.

.. warning::

    Preserving RIDs within metadata tables might require AsmResolver to make use of the Edit-And-Continue metadata tables (such as the pointer tables). The resulting tables stream could therefore be renamed from ``#~`` to ``#-``, and the file size might increase.


String folding in #Strings stream
---------------------------------

Named metadata members (such as types, methods and fields) are assigned a name by referencing a string in the ``#Strings`` stream by its starting offset. When a metadata member has a name that is a suffix of another member's name, then it is possible to only store the longer name in the ``#Strings`` stream, and let the member with the shorter name use an offset within the middle of this longer name. For example, consider two members with the names ``ABCDEFG`` and ``DEFG``. If ``ABCDEFG`` is stored at offset ``1``, then the name ``DEFG`` is implicitly defined at offset ``1 + 3 = 4``, and can thus be referenced without appending ``DEFG`` to the stream a second time.

By default, the PE image builder will fold strings in the ``#Strings`` stream as described in the above. However, for some input binaries, this might make the building process take a significant amount of time. Therefore, to disable this folding of strings, specify the ``NoStringsStreamOptimization`` flag in your ``DotNetDirectoryFactory``:

.. code-block:: csharp

    factory.MetadataBuilderFlags |= MetadataBuilderFlags.NoStringsStreamOptimization;


.. warning::
    Some obfuscated binaries might include lots of members that have very long but similar names. For these types of binaries, disabling this optimization can result in a significantly larger output file size.


.. note::

    When ``PreserveStringIndices`` is set and string folding is enabled (``NoStringsStreamOptimization`` is unset), the PE image builder will not fold strings from the original ``#Strings`` stream into each other. However, it will still try to reuse these original strings as much as possible.


Preserving maximum stack depth
------------------------------

CIL method bodies work with a stack, and the stack has a pre-defined size. This pre-defined size is defined by the ``MaxStack`` property of the ``CilMethodBody`` class. By default, AsmResolver automatically calculates the maximum stack depth of a method body upon writing the module to the disk. However, this is not always desirable.

To override this behaviour, set ``ComputeMaxStackOnBuild`` to ``false`` on all method bodies to exclude in the maximum stack depth calculation.

Alternatively, if you want to force the maximum stack depths should be either preserved or recalculated, it is possible to provide a custom implemenmtation of the ``IMethodBodySerializer``, or configure the ``CilMethodBodySerializer``.

Below an example on how to preserve maximum stack depths for all methods in the assembly:

.. code-block:: csharp

    DotNetDirectoryFactory factory = ...;
    factory.MethodBodySerializer = new CilMethodBodySerializer
    {
        ComputeMaxStackOnBuildOverride = false
    }
    

.. warning::

    Disabling max stack computation may have unexpected side-effects (such as rendering certain CIL method bodies invalid). 



Strong name signing
-------------------

Assemblies can be signed with a strong-name signature. Open a strong name private key from a file:

.. code-block:: csharp
    
    var snk = StrongNamePrivateKey.FromFile(@"C:\Path\To\keyfile.snk");
    
Prepare the image builder to delay-sign the PE image:
 
.. code-block:: csharp
    
    DotNetDirectoryFactory factory = ...;
    factory.StrongNamePrivateKey = snk;
    
After writing the module to an output stream, use the ``StrongNameSigner`` class to sign the image.

.. code-block:: csharp

    using Stream outputStream = ...
    module.Write(outputStream, factory);
    
    var signer = new StrongNameSigner(snk);
    signer.SignImage(outputStream, module.Assembly.HashAlgorithm);


.. _dotnet-image-builder-diagnostics:

Image Builder Diagnostics 
-------------------------

.NET modules that contain invalid metadata and/or method bodies might cause problems upon serializing it to a PE image or file. 
To inspect all errors that occurred during the construction of a PE image, call the ``CreateImage`` method with the ``ErrorListener`` property set to an instance of the ``DiagnosticBag`` property. 
This is an implementation of ``IErrorListener`` that collects all the problems that occurred during the process:

.. code-block:: csharp

    // Set up a diagnostic bag as an error listener.
    var diagnosticBag = new DiagnosticBag();
    imageBuilder.ErrorListener = diagnosticBag;

    // Build image.
    var result = imageBuilder.CreateImage(module);

    // Print all errors.
    Console.WriteLine("Construction finished with {0} errors.", diagnosticBag.Exceptions.Count);
    foreach (var error in diagnosticBag.Exceptions)
        Console.WriteLine(error.Message);


Whenever a problem is reported, AsmResolver attempts to recover or fill in default data where corrupted data was encountered. 
To simply build the PE image ignoring all diagnostic errors, it is also possible to pass in ``EmptyErrorListener.Instance`` instead:

.. code-block:: csharp

    imageBuilder.ErrorListener = EmptyErrorListener.Instance;


.. warning::

    Using ``EmptyErrorListener`` will surpress any non-critical builder errors, however these errors are typically indicative of an invalid executable being constructed. 
    Therefore, even if an output file is produced, it may have unexpected side-effects (such as the file not functioning properly).


.. note::

    Setting an instance of ``IErrorListener`` in the image builder will only affect the building process.
    If the input module is initialized from a file containing invalid metadata, you may still experience reader errors, even if an ``EmptyErrorListener`` is specified.
    See :ref:`dotnet-advanced-module-reading` for handling reader diagnostics.


To test whether any of the errors resulted in AsmResolver to abort the construction of the image, use the ``PEImageBuildResult::HasFailed`` property.
If this property is set to ``false``, the image stored in the ``ConstructedImage`` property can be written to the disk:

.. code-block:: csharp

    if (!result.HasFailed)
    {
        var fileBuilder = new ManagedPEFileBuilder();
        var file = fileBuilder.CreateFile(result.ConstructedImage);
        file.Write("output.exe");
    }
